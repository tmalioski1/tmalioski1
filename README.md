### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack software developer with a strong passion for creating innovative and user-friendly applications. I have experience utilizing JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, HTML and CSS. Additionally, I have developed skills in both back and front end-development. Currently, I am focusing on a personal project where I am cloning the Barnes & Noble website - appropriately names Barnes N Mimic. Barnes N Mimic features a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate through a library of books, search for specific titles and authors, and add books to a shopping cart for purchases or to a wishlist for potential future purchases.
