### Open To Work ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack software developer with a strong passion for creating innovative and user-friendly applications. I have experience utilizing JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, HTML and CSS. Additionally, I have developed skills in both back and front end-development. Currently, I am focusing on refactoring the database of my Barnes N Mimic application, with the objective of optimizing data extraction processes for enhanced efficiency.  In my free time I love traveling the globe and spending time out in nature.  I would certainly be more than willing to accept employment in a different country!
